# CV-Final-Project-MeanShift 
This is a final project in a course called computer vision.
# Usage #
The programming model inclues a function <code>MeanShift(const IplImage*, int**)</code>. It will return a integer, the clustering result. The amount of colors depends on clustering number.

We can control two parameters, <code>spatial_radius</code> and <code>color_radius</code>. The input is a picture and output is a picture after doing meanshift.
# Method #
## Mean Shift ##
1. Convert the color space from RGB to LUV
2. For every pixel calculate the mean vector when the pixel(x,y)'s distance between center < spatial bandwidth, color(l,u,v) of the pixel and the center’s distance < range bandwidth.
3. Let the original pixel’s color equal to the final center’s color.
4. Eliminate spatial regions containing less than M pixels.
## Clustering ##
- Connect neighboring pixel if they belong to same mode(cluster) using stack.
